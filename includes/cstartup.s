; The vector table is normally located at address 0.
; When debugging in RAM, it can be located in RAM, aligned to at least 2^6.
; The name "__vector_table" has special meaning for C-SPY:
; it is where the SP start value is found, and the NVIC vector
; table register (VTOR) is initialized to this address if != 0.
